    <h1>Raspberry Pi Information Display</h1>

                The main goal of this project was to develop a responsive information display system for a Raspberry Pi,
                which would be connected to a vertical TV. The client's requirements included the integration of various
                data inputs onto a single page, necessitating the creation of a backend to fetch data from different
                services via APIs. <br />
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Additionally, the project involved the challenge of displaying an RTSP stream on the screen, which required
        innovative solutions. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Data Integration:</strong> Integrating data from multiple sources into a single page presented a
        significant challenge. Each data source had its own API structure and requirements, requiring meticulous backend
        development.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>RTSP Stream:</strong> One of the client's key requirements was displaying an RTSP stream on the
        Raspberry Pi. However, web browsers do not natively support RTSP, prompting the need for a creative solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Solutions Implemented</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Technology Stack:</strong> Initially, the project was developed using Svelte, but after careful
        consideration, it was transitioned to jQuery to simplify and optimize the solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Backend Development:</strong> Python, along with Flask, was employed to create a robust backend. Custom
        modules were developed to retrieve data from various APIs, including services like Ecowitt and Bluriiot,
        ensuring seamless data integration.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>RTSP Streaming:</strong> To overcome the browser limitations regarding RTSP streams, ffmpeg was
        leveraged to convert the stream into a JPEG sequence. This inventive approach enabled the smooth display of the
        RTSP stream on the vertical TV.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Configurability:</strong> A highly configurable system was designed, allowing for easy adjustments
        through a configuration file. This file accommodated data types, units, RTSP URL, and credentials for user
        customization.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>User-Friendly Scripts:</strong> To simplify installation and uninstallation processes, bash scripts were
        created. These scripts also added menu entries for user convenience, making it effortless to run and configure
        the system.
    </p>

                The project resulted in the successful creation of a responsive information display system that met the
                client's expectations. It effectively integrated data from diverse sources and overcame the challenges
                associated with RTSP streaming. <br />
            </p>

        The addition of a dark mode option enhanced user experience, and the system's configurability ensures
        flexibility for future adaptations.

        Working on this project enhanced my skills in backend development, data integration, and creative
        problem-solving. It underscored the importance of adaptability and the ability to choose the right technologies
        for the task at hand.

        <p>
            From the onset, Tuğrul demonstrated a high level of proficiency and commitment to the project. He was
            responsible for developing and implementing software to display information on a physical screen using a
            Raspberry Pi computer. His tasks included working with webcams and APIs to gather and display real-time data
            on a Samsung iFrame set up in a vertical layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the project, Tuğrul showcased not only strong technical skills but also excellent collaboration
            and communication abilities. He was consistently proactive in troubleshooting issues and took the time to
            collaborate with stakeholders to ensure the project requirements were met effectively and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            What impressed me the most was Tuğrul's ability to deliver quality work within the stipulated timeframe. His
            skill in API integration and real-time data display was evident as the project came together smoothly and met
            all the predetermined requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am extremely satisfied with the work Tuğrul has done and can vouch for his technical skills, work ethic,
            and professional attitude. I would not hesitate to engage him in future projects and highly recommend him
            for any endeavors he chooses to pursue.
