            <p>
                I was in my last year in one of the public high schools in Istanbul,
                <a href="https://yesilkoyanadolu.meb.k12.tr/">Yesilkoy Anadolu Lisesi</a>, where some of my sweetest
                memories were formed. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though we had internet <sub>haha</sub>, we were still writing our yearbook entries using a text
                editor and passing them to the teacher with USB sticks. <br />
                I wasn't aware of any website that eased this process, and even though I should have been studying for
                my university exam, I thought this would be a good project, and I thought I could manage them both.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        So in a week or so, I set up Apache on a Windows machine that resided in my home, configured the router to
        forward the required port, got a free dynamic DNS domain, and wrote several PHP pages to make it work.<br />
    </p>

    <h3>The Workflow</h3>

    There was no registration. I don't remember how I got all of the students' names, but I just hard-coded everyone's
    name in a big select tag. Then I somehow generated unique passwords for each student and distributed them
    physically.<br />
    So what they needed to do was only:
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the website.</li>
        <li>Pick themselves and the person they wanted to write to.</li>
        <li>Write their yearbook entry and press the Send/Update button.</li>
    </ul>

    Their entries were sent to the computer and stored in a directory.

    <hr />

    I had a few maintenance issues. Whenever something happened to the computer, I needed to be there to fix it in order
    to keep the website alive. It was a 24/7 service after all. <br />
    And whenever a new person needed to be added, or someone lost their password, I was there to modify the site and
    update their passwords.<br />
    So overall, it took some effort and time, but it was a nice thing to have, and I felt useful.<br /><br />

    I wish I had a screenshot, but the only proof that the site existed is this archive...
