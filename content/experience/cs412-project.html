                This project was developed for the CS412 Machine Learning course and focused on building predictive
                models for large-scale Instagram data. The system addresses two core problems: predicting post
                engagement and classifying accounts based on their content and behavior patterns.

        The overall objective was to explore how statistical features and modern language representations can be
        combined to model social media dynamics at scale. My primary contribution was the complete design and
        implementation of the classification pipeline, developed independently.
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <p>
        The dataset contained thousands of accounts with heterogeneous behavior, noisy metadata, and unstructured
        textual content. Accurately modeling such data required careful feature engineering and robust representation
        learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the classification task, the main challenge was extracting meaningful signals from short, informal, and
        multilingual text while maintaining generalization across unseen evaluation datasets.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Data Engineering:</strong> Extensive preprocessing pipelines were implemented to clean profiles,
        normalize engagement statistics, and generate derived behavioral features capturing long-term interaction
        patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Text Representation:</strong> User biographies and captions were encoded using modern embedding models,
        including transformer-based sentence encoders and large-scale semantic representations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Classification Pipeline:</strong> I designed and trained multi-class classifiers to categorize Instagram
        accounts into ten distinct content domains (e.g., fashion, travel, food, entertainment, education). The pipeline
        combined textual embeddings with structured features for improved accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Hyperparameters were tuned using automated optimization frameworks,
        ensuring strong performance across multiple hidden test sets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Evaluation Strategy:</strong> Models were validated against several independent datasets provided during
        the course, emphasizing robustness rather than single-test optimization.
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

                The classification system achieved top performance in the course-wide evaluation, ranking first among
                all project submissions. The model demonstrated consistent generalization across diverse account types
                and content styles. <br />

        The complete project also included a regression component for engagement prediction, enabling comprehensive
        analysis of both content category and popularity dynamics.

    <p>
        I developed the entire classification framework independently, from feature extraction and embedding integration
        to training, evaluation, and optimization. This work was recognized as the highest-performing classification
        system in the course.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project strengthened my experience in applied machine learning, large-scale data modeling, and modern
        NLP-based representation learning, while emphasizing reproducibility and rigorous evaluation.
