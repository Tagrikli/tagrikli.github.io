    <h1>Linux Phone Call Recorder</h1>
    <h4>06/10/2023</h4>

    <p>
        PCMin was a project to build an automatic call recording system for Linux phones. Running as a background
        daemon, it monitors cellular calls through ModemManager and captures both audio channels – the microphone and
        the speaker output – saving each side of the conversation as separate WAV files.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>
        Linux phones like the Librem 5 or PinePhone lack the polished ecosystem of their Android and iOS counterparts.
        Call recording, a feature many take for granted, simply didn't exist in a usable form. The goal was to fill
        that gap with a lightweight, set-and-forget solution.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>D-Bus Integration:</strong> The system hooks into ModemManager via D-Bus, listening for call state
        changes. When a call transitions to active, recording begins automatically. When it terminates, files are
        saved with timestamps, direction (incoming/outgoing), and the caller's number.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Dual Audio Capture:</strong> Using PulseAudio, the application captures from two sources simultaneously
        – the microphone input and the speaker monitor. This separation preserves audio quality and allows for
        post-processing if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>GStreamer Pipeline:</strong> Audio encoding is handled through GStreamer, with raw PulseAudio sources
        piped through caps filters and WAV encoders. The pipeline runs independently for each audio channel, writing
        to temporary files before moving them to permanent storage.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Audio Source Detection:</strong> PulseAudio sources can change between calls, especially when
        switching between earpiece and speakerphone. The system repopulates source names before each recording to
        ensure the correct devices are captured.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The application needed to run continuously without polling,
        responding instantly to call events. GLib's main loop combined with D-Bus signal handlers provided the
        necessary event-driven foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Linux phones have limited resources. The design avoids unnecessary
        processing, using temporary files during recording and only performing file operations when the call ends.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>

    <p>
        This project deepened my understanding of the Linux audio stack – PulseAudio's source/sink model, monitor
        devices, and the intricacies of capturing system audio. Working with D-Bus and ModemManager also provided
        insight into how cellular functionality is exposed to userspace on Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experience highlighted the challenges of developing for niche platforms, where documentation is sparse and
        solutions often require piecing together information from multiple sources.

        Built for the Librem 5, but applicable to any Linux phone running ModemManager and PulseAudio.
