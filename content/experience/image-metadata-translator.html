    <h1>Image Metadata Translator</h1>
    <h4>05/05/2021</h4>
    <div class="text">
        <p>
            A client needed a script that could process a folder of images, read their metadata (title, description,
            keywords), translate the metadata using the DeepL API, and write the translated data back to the images.
            <br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>The project had specific requirements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Allow the user to specify a folder of images, source language, and target language</li>
        <li>Translate EXIF/IPTC metadata fields: Headline, Description, Keywords</li>
        <li>Write the new metadata back to the files without modifying filenames</li>
        <li>Integrate with the DeepL API for translation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        I wrote a Python script that integrated with the DeepL API to automate this manual process. The code was
        designed to be straightforward and well-documented, making it easy for the client to run on their Mac via
        Terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The script handled all the specified metadata fields and included proper error handling for edge cases that
        emerged during development.

            Tuğrul wrote a script in Python that integrated with a third party API to automate a manual process. His
            code was straightforward and well-documented. He went out of his way to resolve some unexpected issues and
            always delivered on time. I would be happy to work with Tuğrul again.
