    <h1>Premiere CSV Marker Importer</h1>

        <p>
            A client needed a tool to import CSV files as markers into Adobe Premiere Pro. The project required handling
            multiple CSV files with customizable settings for marker limits and color coding. <br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>The project had specific requirements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Import multiple CSV files as markers into Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
        <li>Setting to limit the number of markers imported</li>
        <li>Ability to assign different colors for markers from different CSV files</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        I developed a solution that extended an existing open-source project, customizing it to meet the client's
        specific workflow needs. The tool allowed video editors to efficiently import timestamped markers from external
        sources, streamlining their post-production process.
