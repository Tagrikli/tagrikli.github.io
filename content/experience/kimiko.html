                Kimiko was a course project for CS308 at Sabanci University – a Chrome extension that brings real-time
                chat to any website. The idea was simple: people visiting the same URL could communicate with each other
                through a sidebar overlay, creating impromptu communities around shared web content.

    <h3>The Concept</h3>

    <p>
        The extension injects an iframe sidebar into any page the user visits. Each URL becomes a chat room, identified
        by a hashed version of the address. Users can toggle the sidebar with a double-Shift hotkey, resize it to their
        preference, and start chatting with others on the same page.
    </p>

    <p>
        User profiles persist across sessions, storing avatars, usernames, bios, and social links. Clicking on a user
        in the chat reveals their profile, enabling a basic social layer on top of the anonymous chat experience.
    </p>

    <h3>The Architecture</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Chrome Extension:</strong> A content script injects the sidebar iframe and handles cross-origin
        communication between the page and the embedded React app. Chrome storage persists user identity and
        preferences locally.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>React Frontend:</strong> The sidebar UI was built with React and TypeScript, handling message display,
        user input, profile management, and real-time updates. CSS transitions provided smooth animations for settings
        and profile panels.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Node.js Backend:</strong> An Express server with WebSocket support managed real-time message routing.
        MongoDB stored user profiles and message history per URL hash, enabling conversation persistence.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Cross-Origin Communication:</strong> The extension's content script and the iframe run in different
        contexts with different origins. Coordinating user identity and profile updates required careful use of
        postMessage and Chrome's runtime messaging API.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>URL-Based Room Partitioning:</strong> Messages needed to be isolated per URL while maintaining
        performance. Using murmurhash to generate room identifiers from URLs allowed efficient database queries and
        quick client-side routing.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Real-Time Synchronization:</strong> Managing WebSocket connections, handling disconnections gracefully,
        and ensuring message delivery order required a robust client manager that tracked online users per room.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>

    <p>
        This was my first deep dive into browser extension development, and it taught me the intricacies of Chrome's
        extension APIs, content security policies, and the security considerations of injecting code into arbitrary
        web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project also reinforced lessons about real-time systems – managing WebSocket state, handling edge cases in
        connection drops, and designing for the asynchronous nature of distributed chat systems.
