                Developed an Android application that captures images and enables users to select specific regions to
                extract color data. Leveraged this to recommend matching nail products from an inventory. <br />

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <p>
        The biggest challenge was understanding color spaces and color similarity. Different color spaces perceive and
        calculate color similarity differently, and some don't align with how humans actually perceive colors. This
        required deep research into color theory to ensure accurate product matching.

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        Built with pure Java in Android Studio, the application integrated computer vision techniques with real-world
        product mapping. Users could capture or select an image, tap on specific regions to extract colors, and receive
        recommendations for matching nail products from the inventory.

    <p>
        The project significantly enhanced my understanding of color spaces and their practical applications in
        consumer-facing products.
