    <h1>Email PDF Extraction Automation</h1>

        <p>
            A client was receiving 20,000 emails per week, each with a password-protected ZIP file containing a PDF.
            The password for each ZIP file arrived in a separate email. They needed a robust automation solution to
            extract all PDFs without missing any. <br />

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <p>
        This was the first project where I needed to seriously consider data volume and scalability. Processing 20,000
        emails weekly required careful attention to performance, error handling, and ensuring no PDFs were missed.
    </p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Process ~20,000 emails per week automatically</li>
        <li>Match password emails with their corresponding ZIP file emails</li>
        <li>Extract PDFs from password-protected ZIP attachments</li>
        <li>Organize extracted files locally on a Remote Desktop</li>
        <li>Ensure 100% extraction rate—no PDFs could be missed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        I built a Python automation system that parsed Gmail content, matched password emails with their corresponding
        ZIP files, extracted the protected attachments, and organized the data locally. The solution emphasized
        robustness and secure automation workflows to handle the high volume reliably.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project taught me valuable lessons about building scalable systems and the importance of comprehensive
        error handling when dealing with large-scale data processing.
