        <p>
            A client needed a desktop application to monitor the log file of Magic: The Gathering Arena and selectively
            display game actions in real time. The project required parsing undocumented but human-readable logs to
            extract meaningful game events. <br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>The project had specific requirements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Build a desktop app using Python with Kivy or Tkinter</li>
        <li>Monitor game log file in real time</li>
        <li>Parse and display relevant game events:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Match Start</li>
            <li>DeckList for the match</li>
            <li>Cards drawn by player</li>
            <li>Cards played by player</li>
            <li>Cards played by opponent</li>
            <li>Match End and Match Result</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        I developed a Python desktop application that continuously monitored the game's log file, parsing entries to
        identify and display relevant game events in real time. Working with undocumented log formats required careful
        analysis and pattern recognition to accurately extract the required information.
