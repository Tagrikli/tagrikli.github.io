                The project presented a significant challenge as it required bridging the gap between disparate software
                systems—specifically, Rhino with Grasshopper and MATLAB—for an academic research initiative led by an
                esteemed architecture professor at Istanbul Technical University. <br />

        The main challenge was to seamlessly integrate these distinct platforms to facilitate the research process. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <p>
        To address this challenge effectively, I embarked on a comprehensive research journey to familiarize myself with
        Rhino, Grasshopper, and MATLAB, even though I had no prior experience with these tools. After gaining a
        foundational understanding of these technologies, I devised an innovative solution using Python as the central
        bridge.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Flask Application:</strong> I developed a Flask application to serve as the intermediary between Rhino
        with Grasshopper and MATLAB. This application was configured to communicate with a specific Grasshopper
        component designed for network data exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Python Integration:</strong> Leveraging Python's versatility, I utilized a Python module to interact
        programmatically with MATLAB. This allowed for the seamless transmission of input data to MATLAB and the
        retrieval of relevant results.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Networking:</strong> I established a robust networking framework to enable the smooth transfer of data
        between the different software environments. This network connectivity formed the backbone of the entire
        solution, ensuring data exchange and synchronization between Rhino with Grasshopper and MATLAB.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
        By meticulously implementing this comprehensive solution, I successfully bridged the gap between Rhino with
        Grasshopper and MATLAB, facilitating the academic research project's objectives. This innovative approach
        streamlined the research process, enabling efficient data exchange and computation between the two distinct
        platforms.

        The professor mentioned that I would be thanked in the acknowledgements section of the resulting article—and
        they followed through. I'm literally in the acknowledgements part of
        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00038628.2023.2269549#:~:text=Tu%C4%9Frul%20Agrikli">the published paper</a>.
