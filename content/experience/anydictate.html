                I have developed a dynamic web application that harnesses the power of Python and the Web Speech API to
                provide real-time speech-to-text conversion. With this innovative tool, users can effortlessly convert
                their spoken words into written text. <br />

    <p>
        The application seamlessly integrates with various platforms, allowing users to input text wherever a cursor can
        be placed. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <p>
        Using the Web Speech API, the application records speech input and swiftly converts it into textual format. This
        text is then sent to the backend, powered by Python, which emulates key presses to effectively simulate typing.
    </p>

    <p>
        This unique functionality enables users to effortlessly type anywhere, saving time and streamlining their
        workflow. By combining the strengths of web technologies and Python, this project offers a versatile solution
        for those who prefer speech input over traditional typing.
