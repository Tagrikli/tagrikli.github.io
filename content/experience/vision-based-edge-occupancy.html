    <h1>Vision-Based Edge Occupancy Detection</h1>
    <h4>04/01/2026</h4>

    <p>
        This graduation project focused on replacing expensive laser scanners in automated parking systems with a
        computer vision–based solution. The goal was to detect whether a vehicle extends beyond pallet edges—an error
        that can cause serious collisions during automated transport—using low-cost cameras and edge AI hardware.

    <p>
        Existing industrial systems rely on laser sensors costing thousands of euros per unit and suffer from
        reliability issues with dark vehicle surfaces. My objective was to demonstrate that a carefully engineered deep
        learning system could match their accuracy at a fraction of the cost.
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <p>
        The main technical challenge was building a reliable safety-critical classifier from limited real-world data
        collected in a single parking facility. While occupied pallets naturally vary with different vehicles, empty
        pallets are visually uniform, creating strong risks of overfitting and poor generalization.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additional constraints included real-time inference requirements, low hardware budgets, and strict limits on
        false negatives, where missed detections could lead to physical damage.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Data Pipeline:</strong> I designed a semi-automated labeling system that reduced manual annotation
        effort from over 200 hours to roughly 2 hours, enabling efficient creation of a high-quality dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Architecture:</strong> A MobileNetV3-based convolutional neural network was implemented using
        transfer learning, optimized for deployment on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Validation Methodology:</strong> Through systematic error analysis, I refined the augmentation and
        testing pipeline after discovering that common occlusion techniques introduced misleading artifacts. This led to
        a more realistic and robust evaluation framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Synthetic Data Generation:</strong> To address limited environmental diversity, I developed a
        Blender-based rendering pipeline that generated thousands of labeled synthetic images. Pre-training on this
        dataset significantly improved generalization to unseen conditions.

    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Deployment Architecture:</strong> A modular real-time processing pipeline was designed for multi-camera
        monitoring, enabling low-latency inference and redundancy-based safety guarantees.
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>
        The final system achieved up to 98.94% validation accuracy on real operational data and maintained strong
        performance under simulated environmental variations. Synthetic pre-training further improved robustness while
        reducing false positives by over 70%.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compared to traditional laser-based systems, the solution offers approximately 96% cost reduction while
        eliminating color-dependent failure modes.

    <p>
        Beyond technical performance, this project provided hands-on experience in building industrial-grade machine
        learning systems under real operational constraints—from data acquisition and validation design to deployment
        planning and ethical considerations.
