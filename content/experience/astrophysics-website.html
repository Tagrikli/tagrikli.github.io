                The goal of this project was to enhance an existing academic website developed for astrophysicist
                teachers at my university. The website consisted of two servers, with one server responsible for
                gathering measurements from NASA and performing calculations to detect cosmic events, while the other
                server displayed the results and facilitated data queries. <br />

        However, there were several challenges that needed to be addressed to improve the efficiency and usability of
        the system. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenges</h3>

    <p>
        The existing system required manual data transfers between servers, which was time-consuming and prone to human
        error. The user interface was outdated, making it difficult for professors to efficiently search and analyze
        data. Additionally, there was no proper database integration for managing the calculated results.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Automated Data Transfer:</strong> I developed a solution that automated the data transfer process using
        Python and FTP. This eliminated the need for manual transfers between servers, saving time and reducing the
        risk of human error.

                <strong>Modern UI:</strong> I revamped the website's user interface by replacing the outdated UI with a
                modern Material UI framework. This upgrade enhanced the overall user experience and enabled the
                implementation of advanced search and display functionalities. <br />

    <p>
        <strong>Database Integration:</strong> To facilitate data management, I integrated a database into the website.
        This allowed for seamless storage, retrieval, and presentation of the calculated data, improving the overall
        efficiency and accessibility of the system.

        Throughout the project, I utilized various technologies, including Bash, Python, SQL, and PHP, to develop and
        implement the solutions. These tools were instrumental in achieving the project's goals and delivering a more
        efficient and user-friendly website for astrophysicist teachers.
